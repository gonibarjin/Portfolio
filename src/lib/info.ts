    bio: "Frontend development quickly became the place where everything clicked for me. What excites me most is the mix of creativity and logic, the satisfaction of seeing something take shape as I build it, and the joy of creating experiences that others can actually use. Iâ€™m curious by nature and enjoy experimenting, always looking for new ways to learn and grow. For me, frontend is not just about code, but about putting care and passion into details that make a difference",
